# Location_specific_AQI_analysis

To gain practical experience, I chose to work with the [World Air Quality Dataset](https://aqicn.org/historical/#city:india/mumbai) for Mumbai. This real-life dataset, with its anomalies and outliers, provides a challenging and insightful experience beyond the conventional Kaggle datasets.

In this project, I aim to:

  - Analyze the air quality of 8 regions in Mumbai.
  
  - Create basic plots of normalized hazardous gas concentration levels.
  
  - Perform RBF Kernel-based (Fourier) interpolation.
  
  - Develop an extrapolation model for the next two years.
  
  - Additionally, this project aims to raise awareness about the rising air pollution and its threat to air quality.
